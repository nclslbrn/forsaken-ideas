# Forsaken ideas

P5.JS/THREE.JS/whatever libraries sketchbook build with Vite and Vue.

Forsaken-Ideas is a workflow to create a gallery from a folder which contains many bundled project.

The gallery is developed with VueJS, it's quite simple, it's a classic project that queries a JSON file (in production / you don't need to rebuild the Vue app to add a new project) to list all the projects.

The part that generates the projects is more interesting. The usual `yarn run dev` command is sufixed with the project name, enabling you to generate a multitude of projects from a single configuration. So, to develop project x (contained in the sketch/x/ folder) you can run yarn run sketch:dev x, which will set sketch/x/index.js as the input to your application (used by Vite).

This workflow is designed to be modular and space-saving, so the p5.js and three.js libraries are loaded from a cdn. To indicate how to load the library, simply specify it in a file named property.json (sort of tiny and internal package.json), which must be present in all projects. It is used to indicate information that will be reinjected into the HTML template (interaction button with the program, display of a short note on the project, date, topic...) and in the gallery.

│   ├──  a-title-of-a-projec/ 	
│   │				Where you code new sketch
│   ├──  assets/ 		A folder to store some files (fonts, img), Vite will lookat this specific folder
│   ├──  index.js 		Sketch entry point
│   ├──  property.json 		Sketch properties, details below
│   ├──  capture.jpg 		1200px illustration for Open Graph (adapt the height to fit you image ratio)
│   └──  thumbnail.jpg 		600px image for gallery (adapt the height too)
